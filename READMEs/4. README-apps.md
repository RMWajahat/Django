## APPS installation
python manage.py startapp <name_of_app>    <!-- this will create a new app  -->

### STEPS TO FOLLOW AFETR CREATING APP
    1. When a new app is created then we need to tell the main project to get know of new app. 
    HOW?
    - Go to settings.py in main folder & in installed apps add the name of app you created.
    - If we make templates folder in first_app seperatly then we don't need to configure that templates folder again in settings.py
    - If you want suggestions in vscode sub-apps then go to setting>search emmit>go to add language>ITEM: django-html, value: html> and add item
    - use `include` to include sub-routes in main urls.py      This will transfer control to the apps urls.py file where rest logic of displaying templates in views is same
