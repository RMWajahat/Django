# Making templates 
### React ka components jaisa hai

1. Create one layout.html file in templates folder-- main folder level
2. Define there what will remain constant there all tiem on website like navbar, footer etc.


3. Then whena new file of html is to be created in that project(I am not talking about single app) then we will use

{%block <variable_name>%} {%endblock%} in layout file


Use in all files like:
{% extends "layout/layout.html" %}    <!--telling app that which template to use ----- Ya ye inject kahan krna code blocks-->

<!-- This is the title block which is defined in the base.html file -->
{% block title %} 
    Categories
{% endblock %}




{% block content %} <!-- This is the content block which is defined in the base.html file -->
    <h1>Welcome to Categories Section    |    Categories Page</h1>
    <h2>All categories for you here.</h2>

{% endblock %}
